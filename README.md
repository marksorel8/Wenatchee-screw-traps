This repository is associated with the in prep. manuscript:

"Density and climate effects on the abundance of juvenile salmon across alternative life histories"
By: Mark H. Sorel, Andrew R. Murdoch, Richard W. Zabel, Cory M. Kamphaus, Eric R. Buhle, Mark D. Scheuerell, and Sarah J. Converse

The goal of this repository is to model the abundance juvenile Chinook salmon emigrating from natal streams at different ages in the Wenatchee Basin.

The controlling script for the analysis is `SR_all_LVR.R`, which sources a number of other `R` and `.cpp` scripts within the `src` folder. 

One folder within the "src" folder, called "mortality-migration-example" was an exploratory analysis that was not included in the manuscript.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks!
